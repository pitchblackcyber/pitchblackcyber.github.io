        <h3>Why Home Cybersecurity Matters</h3>
        <p>
          Home networks are no longer simple Wi-Fi and a laptop. Today they are full of smart TVs, 
          phones, game consoles, smart speakers, security cameras, and work-from-home devices. 
          Attackers know this and actively target home users—especially seniors, families, and remote workers—
          with scams, phishing emails, and malicious websites.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pitch Black Cyber provides a <strong>managed home cybersecurity service</strong> that adds a 
          dedicated network firewall appliance to your home and includes ongoing monitoring, protection, 
          and support. You get peace of mind knowing someone is watching your digital front door.

      <!-- FAQ -->
      <section id="faq">
        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

        <h4>Do I have to change my internet provider?</h4>
        <p>No. The firewall appliance works with most common home internet providers and routers. We simply connect it to your existing equipment.</p>

        <h4>Will this slow down my internet?</h4>
        <p>
          For most homes, the impact is minimal and often unnoticeable. We’ll recommend the right hardware model based on your connection speed.
        </p>

        <h4>What happens if something breaks?</h4>
        <p>
          If you lose connectivity or see something strange, you contact us and we’ll walk you through a fix or adjust the configuration remotely.
        </p>

        <h4>Can you help my parents or grandparents even if they live in another city?</h4>
        <p>
          Yes. As long as they have an internet connection and we can ship or install the device, we can manage their protection remotely.
