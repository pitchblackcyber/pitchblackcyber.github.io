# Pitch Black Cyber Website

## Overview

Pitch Black Cyber is a modern, dark‑themed website built to represent a cybersecurity consulting and implementation firm. The site emphasizes professionalism, trust, and cutting‑edge technology while maintaining an accessible and visually compelling design.

This project includes two main files:

* **index.html** — the website’s core structure and content
* **style.css** — a sleek, responsive dark theme with neon accents that elevate visual impact

The design uses a black‑hole inspired palette with hues of purple, cyan, and magenta to symbolize mystery, precision, and energy — aligning with the company’s name and mission.

## Features

* **Responsive layout** optimized for desktop and mobile
* **Sticky navigation bar** with smooth hover transitions
* **Dynamic hero section** with glowing gradient headline
* **Card‑based service sections** for clarity and structure
* **Accessible contact form** with focus and hover states
* **Minimal dependencies** (pure HTML + CSS, no frameworks)

## Project Structure

```

│
├── index.html      # Main landing page
├── style.css       # Custom site styling
└── assets/         # (Optional) images, icons, or logos
```

## Customization

* Update the company description and service list inside `index.html`.
* Modify the accent colors in `:root` within `style.css` to change the color theme.
* Add new sections (e.g., Portfolio, Careers) following existing section markup.

## Deployment

This site can be deployed easily using GitHub Pages, Netlify, or any static hosting platform.

### GitHub Pages Example

1. Push your code to a GitHub repository.
2. Go to **Settings → Pages → Source**, select `main` branch, and `/ (root)` folder.
3. The site will be live at `https://<your‑username>.github.io/pitch‑black‑cyber/`.

## Future Enhancements

* Add a **hamburger menu** for small screens
* Include a **CTA hero button** (e.g., “Schedule a Consultation”)
* Integrate **contact form backend** via Formspree, Netlify Forms, or custom API
* Add **animations** with lightweight CSS keyframes or GSAP for interactivity
